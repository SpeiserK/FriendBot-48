- Spellchecker method: This method will correct any spelling mistakes made in the message sent by the user. The agent will then respond to the correctly spelled sentence. If the message sent by the user is VERY misspelled, the agent will notify the user that it does not understand.

- Parts of speech tagging Method: This method can identify the type of words used in the message sent by the user. Depending on the number of nouns in the message the agent will reply with multiple outputs. This can make conversations more interesting and shows that the agent is trying to keep the conversation flowing.
