# Friend Maker-Inator
Bot that converses with the user

Our agent receives an input from the user via our Discord messaging channel. The agent then uses a keyword system to generate an appropriate output message. The output message is then sent to the user via the Discord channel.

# Assignment 3 - Features
- Switch statement keyword system: Our agent uses a keyword system to generate the appropriate output to send to the user. The keyword system is fitted with multiple topics, greetings, small-talk phrases, and reactions that can be used in the agent's output. We have even implemented some randomization when it comes to the agent's response, so that the conversation can always be unique.

- Spellchecker method: This method will correct any spelling mistakes made in the message sent by the user. The agent will then respond to the correctly spelled sentence. If the message sent by the user is very misspelled, the agent will notify the user that it does not understand.

- Parts of speech tagging Method: This method can identify the type of words used in the message sent by the user. Depending on the nouns used in the sentence the agent will respond with a more engaged output. This can make conversations more interesting and shows that the agent is trying to keep the conversation flowing.

POS Tagging: The agent is able to identify the specific item that the user is talking about and delivers an involved response.
